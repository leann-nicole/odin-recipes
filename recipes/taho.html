    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Taho is a type of snack in the Philippines. It has a pudding-like texture. The toppings include a sweet brown syrup called arnibal, and sago pearls. You will often see hawkers early in the morning selling taho on the streets.
    <p>I love having taho for breakfast. When we are in Manila, we make sure to wake-up early to be able to purchase some from the “magtataho”. This is something that cannot be bought in the states, so I make one for myself and my family. The recipe below shows you how I do it. It is easier than you think.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>22 ounces soft silken tofu</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sago pearls</li>
        <li>5 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 5 cups of water in a cooking pot and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the sago pearls. Boil for 3 to 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to low setting, continue boiling for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the hot water by filtering the sago using a kitchen strainer. Put the sago pearls in a bowl with warm water and let it stay until needed.</li>
        <li>Make the arnibal by boiling 3/4 cup water in a saucepan. Add the brown sugar. Stir. Add the vanilla extract. Turn the heat off. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer the extra soft tofu in a bowl. Microwave it for 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange the soft tofu in individual cups. Top with sago pearls and pour arnibal (syrup) on top. Serve warm. Share and Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
